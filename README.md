# üñºÔ∏è Stable Diffusion Image Generator

A simple Text-to-Image Generator built with Python using Hugging Face‚Äôs Diffusers library and the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model. It allows users to input a text prompt and generates a high-quality AI-generated image based on the description. The app runs on GPU for fast performance and supports real-time prompt input through the terminal. Designed to be lightweight and easy to use, the project leverages PyTorch, Transformers, and Accelerate for seamless model loading and execution. Ideal for artists, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to create stunning visuals from plain text with minimal setup.
